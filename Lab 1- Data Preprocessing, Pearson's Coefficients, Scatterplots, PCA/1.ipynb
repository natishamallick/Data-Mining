Perform data cleaning in order to replace any NaN values with the mean of the value for a given field. Then replace any categorical labels with numerical labels. Display the resulting dataset. You can use the sklearn.impute and sklearn.preprocessing packages to asssist you. [1 mark out of 5]\n",

    "5. Load the CSV file shoesize.csv, which includes measurements of shoe size and height (in inches) for 408 subjects, both female and male. Plot the scatterplots of shoe size versus height for female and male subjects separately. Compute the Pearson's correlation coefficient of shoe size versus height for female and male subjects separately. What can be inferred by the scatterplots and computed correlation coefficients? You can implement your own formulation of the correlation coefficient or use the scipy.stats package to assist you. [1 mark out of 5]\n",

    "6. Using the pre-processed breast cancer dataset from subsection 1.1 of this notebook (which replaced any missing values with their median), perform Principal Component Analysis with 2 components. Compute the explained variance ratio for each component, and plot the scatterplot of all samples along the two principal components, color-coded according to the \"Class\" column (this column should not be used in the PCA analysis). Ensure that your data is normalized prior to performing PCA. What insights can you obtain by the explained variance ratio of each component, and by viewing the scatterplot of the principal components? [1 mark out of 5]\n"
